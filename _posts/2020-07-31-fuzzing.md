A radio antenna shifted and plunged me into static. I turned it off weeks ago, but I still hear the buzzing. I think it’ll end soon.  
  
I see a heat haze, my vision fuzzing. Was it this dark outside when I closed my eyes, or is this the right time to wake up? The lightbulbs twitch and it’s a week later. They’re mowing the lawn again. They did it yesterday or two weeks ago, but I still hear the humming. I think it’ll stop soon.  
  
Just two more minutes. Just two more days. Just two more months. 
The static noise pulsates, but only when I tune into it--it’s rhythmic when I hear the rhythms, but when’s the last time I did?  
I think it’ll be over soon.
