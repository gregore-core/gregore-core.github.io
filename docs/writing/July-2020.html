    <p>A radio antenna shifted and plunged me into static.<br />
I turned it off weeks ago, but I still hear the buzzing.<br />
I think it’ll end soon.</p>

<p>I see a heat haze, my vision fuzzing.<br />
Was it this dark outside when I closed my eyes, or is this the right time to wake up?<br />
The lightbulbs twitch and it’s a week later.<br />
They’re mowing the lawn again.<br />
They did it yesterday or two weeks ago, but I still hear the humming.<br />
I think it’ll stop soon.</p>

<p>Just two more minutes.<br />
Just two more days.<br />
Just two more months.<br />
The static noise pulsates, but only when I tune into it–it’s rhythmic when I hear the rhythms, but when’s the last time I did?</p>

<p>I think it’ll be over soon.</p>
