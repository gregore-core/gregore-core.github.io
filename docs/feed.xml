I turned it off weeks ago, but I still hear the buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;
I think it’ll end soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a heat haze, my vision fuzzing.&lt;br /&gt;
Was it this dark outside when I closed my eyes, or is this the right time to wake up?&lt;br /&gt;
The lightbulbs twitch and it’s a week later.&lt;br /&gt;
They’re mowing the lawn again.&lt;br /&gt;
They did it yesterday or two weeks ago, but I still hear the humming.&lt;br /&gt;
I think it’ll stop soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two more minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
Just two more days.&lt;br /&gt;
Just two more months.&lt;br /&gt;
The static noise pulsates, but only when I tune into it–it’s rhythmic when I hear the rhythms, but when’s the last time I did?&lt;/p&gt;
